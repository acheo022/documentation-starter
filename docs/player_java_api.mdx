# JavaScript API Calls

#### Description

You can use JavaScript API to integrate applications with the movingimage video player.

With the JavaScript API you can:

*   Add, remove or connect to a player using the VideoPlayerCollection
*   basic player functions such as play, pause or stop a video
*   register functions to player events to collect usage statistics or add interactive functionality
*

#### Embed Codes

You will need the video embed codes in your VideoManager to use the JavaScript API.

In VideoManager Pro, embed codes are found in a video's **Publish** view:

Use the "HTML-CODE" (the other embed types cannot be used with this API) - an example code is shown below:

```
<div mi24-video-player video-id="4Zo1QNH5FKxQDLsgKBpvD8"
player-id="2X32X_p31xVFCpkY7KoDhj" config-type="vmpro"
flash-path="//e.video-cdn.net/v2/" api-url="//d.video-cdn.net/play">
</div><script src="//e.video-cdn.net/v2/embed.js"></script>
```

``

You can also get a video's embed code using the "[embed-codes](https://doc.movingimage.com/display/LT/movingimage+REST+API#/reference/video/embed-codes/get-embed-codes-of-specific-video)" endpoint of the movingimage REST API.

Each embed code includes the JavaScript source; this is the "embed.js" file, which is needed to make the embed code work.

However, it only needs to be added to the page once, regardless of how many players will be added to the page.

The embed code also includes a `<div>` that contains our `"mi24-video-player" `tag and the following attributes:

*
*   video-id "`4Zo1QNH5FKxQDLsgKBpvD8`":  a unique string identifying the video that will be embedded (the value listed here is just an example)
*   player-id "`2X32X_p31xVFCpkY7KoDhj`": a unique string identifying the Player that the embedded video will use (the value listed here is just an example)
*   config-type "`vmpro`": indicates the VideoManager type the embed code is for ("vmpro" or "vm")
*   flash-path "`//e.video-cdn.net/v2/`": the flash path of the Player (this is used to supply a backup Flash player in the event that the HTML5 player does not load)
*   api-url "`//d.video-cdn.net/play`" the URL of the API
